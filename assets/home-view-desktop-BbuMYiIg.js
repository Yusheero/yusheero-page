Better Logic Reuse",'With composition functions (often called "composables"), you can extract and reuse stateful logic',"across multiple components. This is more powerful and flexible than mixins or other previous patterns.","","```js","// useUserStatus.js",'import { ref, computed } from "vue";',"","export function useUserStatus() {","  const isLoggedIn = ref(false);",'  const userRole = ref("guest");',"","  const hasAdminAccess = computed(() => {",'    return isLoggedIn.value && userRole.value === "admin";',"  });","","  function login(role) {","    isLoggedIn.value = true;","    userRole.value = role;","  }","","  function logout() {","    isLoggedIn.value = false;",'    userRole.value = "guest";',"  }","","  return {","    isLoggedIn,","    userRole,","    hasAdminAccess,","    login,","    logout","  };","}","```","","### 2. Better Type Inference","TypeScript works more naturally with the Composition API, providing better type inference","without the need for complex type augmentation.","","### 3. Smaller Production Bundle","The Composition API can lead to better tree-shaking, resulting in smaller production bundles.","","## Practical Example","","Let's look at a simple comparison between Options API and Composition API:","","### Options API:","```js","export default {","  data() {","    return {",'      searchQuery: "",',"      searchResults: [],","      isLoading: false,","      error: null","    };","  },","  methods: {","    async fetchResults() {","      this.isLoading = true;","      try {","        const results = await api.search(this.searchQuery);","        this.searchResults = results;","        this.error = null;","      } catch (err) {","        this.error = err.message;","        this.searchResults = [];","      } finally {","        this.isLoading = false;","      }","    }","  },","  watch: {","    searchQuery(newQuery) {","      if (newQuery.length > 2) {","        this.fetchResults();","      } else {","        this.searchResults = [];","      }","    }","  }","};","```","","### Composition API:","```js",'import { ref, watch } from "vue";','import { api } from "@/api";',"","export default {","  setup() {",'    const searchQuery = ref("");',"    const searchResults = ref([]);","    const isLoading = ref(false);","    const error = ref(null);","","    async function fetchResults() {","      isLoading.value = true;","      try {","        const results = await api.search(searchQuery.value);","        searchResults.value = results;","        error.value = null;","      } catch (err) {","        error.value = err.message;","        searchResults.value = [];","      } finally {","        isLoading.value = false;","      }","    }","","    watch(searchQuery, (newQuery) => {","      if (newQuery.length > 2) {","        fetchResults();","      } else {","        searchResults.value = [];","      }","    });","","    return {","      searchQuery,","      searchResults,","      isLoading,","      error","    };","  }","};","```","","## Conclusion","","The Composition API doesn't replace the Options API—Vue 3 fully supports both. However,","for complex components where related logic needs to stay together, or when you need to","share logic between components, the Composition API offers a more maintainable solution.","","As projects grow in complexity, the benefits of the Composition API become more pronounced,","leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and more reusable code.","","For those just starting with Vue, I still recommend learning the Options API first to understand","Vue's core concepts before diving into the Composition API.","","---",'Type "BLOG" to return to the blog list.',""],2:[">>> FULL ARTICLE:","","# Building Accessible Web Applications: A Comprehensive Guide","Date: 2023-05-22","Tags: #Accessibility #WebDev #UX","","Web accessibility is not just a nice-to-have feature—it's essential for creating","inclusive applications that everyone can use, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.","In this guide, we'll explore practical strategies for building accessible web applications.","","## Why Accessibility Matters","","- **Legal Compliance**: Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility","- **Larger Audience**: Accessible sites can reach 15-20% more users","- **Better UX for Everyone**: Accessibility improvements often benefit all users","- **SEO Benefits**: Many accessibility practices also improve search engine ranking","","## Key Areas of Focus","","### 1. Semantic HTML","","Using the right HTML elements for their intended purpose provides a strong foundation:","","```html","<!-- Poor accessibility -->",'<div class="button" onclick="submit()">Submit</div>',"","<!-- Good accessibility -->",'<button type="submit">Submit</button>',"```","","Always prefer semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<main>`, and `<section>`","over generic `<div>` and `<span>` elements when appropriate.","","### 2. Keyboard Navigation","","Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard:","","- Maintain a logical tab order","- Provide visible focus indicators","- Implement proper focus management for custom widgets","- Test your application using only a keyboard","","### 3. ARIA Attributes","","When HTML semantics aren't enough, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes help:","","```html",'<div role="alert" aria-live="assertive">',"  Form submitted successfully!","</div>","```","",'Remember the first rule of ARIA: "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA." Only use it when necessary.',"","### 4. Color and Contrast","","- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text","- Don't rely solely on color to convey information","- Provide text alternatives for non-text content","- Test your design with color blindness simulators","","### 5. Responsive Design","","- Ensure content is accessible at various zoom levels (up to 200%)","- Design for different viewport sizes","- Use relative units (em, rem) instead of fixed units (px)","- Test with screen magnification tools","","## Testing for Accessibility","","Incorporate these testing methods into your workflow:","","1. **Automated Testing**: Tools like Axe, Lighthouse, and WAVE","2. **Manual Testing**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader testing","3. **User Testing**: Work with people who have disabilities","","## Framework-Specific Considerations","","### Vue.js","","```js","// Accessible Vue component example","<template>","  <button",'    :aria-pressed="isActive"','    @click="toggle"','    class="toggle-button"',"  >","    {{ buttonLabel }}","  </button>","</template>","","<script>","export default {","  data() {","    return {","      isActive: false","    };","  },","  computed: {","    buttonLabel() {",'      return this.isActive ? "Deactivate" : "Activate";',"    }","  },","  methods: {","    toggle() {","      this.isActive = !this.isActive;","    }","  }","};","<\/script>","```","","## Conclusion","","Accessibility is a journey, not a destination. Start with these basics and continuously","improve your applications. Remember that making your application accessible doesn't just","benefit users with disabilities—it creates a better experience for everyone.","","By building accessibility into your development process from the beginning, you'll save","time and resources compared to retrofitting accessibility features later.","","---",'Type "BLOG" to return to the blog list.',""],3:[">>> FULL ARTICLE:","","# Serverless Architecture: When to Use and When to Avoid","Date: 2023-04-10","Tags: #Serverless #Architecture #Cloud","","Serverless computing has transformed how we build and deploy applications by allowing","developers to focus on code without managing infrastructure. But is it always the right choice?","This article explores when serverless shines and when traditional approaches might be better.","","## What is Serverless?","",`Despite the name, serverless doesn't mean "no servers"—it means you don't need to provision,`,"scale, or manage servers yourself. The cloud provider handles these tasks automatically.","","Key serverless offerings include:","","- **Function as a Service (FaaS)**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions","- **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: Firebase, AWS Amplify","- **Serverless Databases**: DynamoDB, Fauna, Firebase Firestore","","## When to Use Serverless","","### 1. Sporadic or Unpredictable Workloads","","Serverless excels when workloads are intermittent or have unpredictable traffic patterns.","You only pay for actual compute time used, which can result in significant cost savings","compared to having servers running 24/7 with low utilization.","","### 2. Microservices Architecture","","Serverless functions are ideal for implementing microservices, allowing you to:","","- Deploy and scale each function independently","- Develop and maintain services in isolation","- Pay only for the resources each service consumes","","### 3. Event-Driven Processing","","For applications that respond to events (file uploads, database changes, messages),","serverless functions provide an elegant solution:","","```javascript","// AWS Lambda example for image processing","exports.handler = async (event) => {","  const s3Event = event.Records[0].s3;","  const bucket = s3Event.bucket.name;","  const key = s3Event.object.key;","","  // Process image from S3","  await processImage(bucket, key);","","  return {","    statusCode: 200,","    body: JSON.stringify({","      message: `Successfully processed ${key}`,","    }),","  };","};","```","","### 4. MVPs and Prototypes","","For new products, serverless allows you to:","","- Get to market quickly with minimal infrastructure setup","- Validate ideas without significant upfront investment","- Scale easily if the product gains traction","","## When to Avoid Serverless","","### 1. Long-Running Processes","","Most FaaS platforms have execution time limits (e.g., AWS Lambda has a 15-minute maximum).","For processes that run longer, traditional servers or container orchestration is more appropriate.","","### 2. Consistent, High-Volume Workloads","","For applications with steady, predictable, high-volume traffic, traditional servers or","containers might be more cost-effective. The pay-per-use model works against you when usage is constant.","","### 3. Low-Latency Requirements","",`Serverless functions can experience "cold starts" when they haven't been invoked recently.`,"This initialization delay can range from milliseconds to several seconds, making them","inappropriate for applications requiring consistent, ultra-low latency.","","### 4. Complex State Management","","Applications requiring complex in-memory state or session management can be challenging","to implement in a serverless architecture, where functions are ephemeral and stateless by design.","","## Hybrid Approaches","","Many successful applications use a hybrid approach:","","- Use serverless for event-driven, bursty workloads","- Use containers or VMs for stable, long-running processes","- Choose the right tool for each component of your system","","## Conclusion","","Serverless isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a powerful tool in your architectural toolkit.","By understanding its strengths and limitations, you can make informed decisions about where","and when to apply serverless principles in your applications.","","When evaluating serverless for your project, consider factors like execution duration,","traffic patterns, latency requirements, and state management needs.
